# Moscato
Project Moscato
To test locally:
1. Install NodeJS on your computer. This allows you to use npm.
2. Pull everything within Moscato to a local folder.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt and change directory (cd) into the Moscato folder.
3. Enter into terminal/command prompt: npm run dev
4. Now whenever you change moscato/src/client/app/index.jsx, npm will use webpack to recompile.
5. Open moscato/src/client/index.html to see your changes
